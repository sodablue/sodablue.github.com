The secret to being wrong isn't to avoid being wrong! The secret is being willing to be wrong. The secret is realizing that wrong isn't fatal.

I decided to try using github pages, which was somewhat limiting.  Looking around further I found Octopress which is
a set of Ruby scripts around the Jekyll engine that github pages uses that starts you off with a nice template and a plugin architecture.

There's no database, it's just all static pages stored in source control.  It's blogging like a true developer! :-)
